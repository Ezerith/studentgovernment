        expenditures that encourage and support student participation
        and leadership in community service projects. Its funds,
        however, are not intended to be spent on donations to charitable
        organizations, merely on supporting student involvement in
        giving back to the community.

        to decide upon an allocation of the expected SAF income for the
        next year.
    23. 2. The SAF Allocation Board will consist of the leaders of each

    25. ##### 4. Funding Guideline Documents

    26. 1. All Student Experience Organizations are required to maintain
        a current, public Funding Guidelines Document which outlines how
        that organization allocates any funds from the SAF that are
        entrusted to it.
    27. 2. If unresolvable, issues students have with how funds are
        being allocated within Student Experience Organizations will be
        addressed by COReâ€™s representative body. As such, the power of
        review for Funding Guideline Documents lies within CORe, for use
        only when students have specific unresolvable issues.
